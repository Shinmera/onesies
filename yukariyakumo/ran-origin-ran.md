# Ran's perspective
Oh dear, let me see. I mean, these are some of my earliest memories, so I probably won't remember everything without a hitch, but I'll try my best! Hmm, where to begin?

I suppose it would be good to explain my whereabouts before I actually met Yukari for the first time. Needless to say I was still a fox back then. I think it was around late Summer or Fall and it was quite chilly. At the time I was in a bit of a pickle since I didn't have much success finding any food. After a long while of travelling the woods looking for edibles, I --at last-- stumbled upon a house.

I didn't really think too much about it. I quickly found what smelled like a store-room and made my way inside through an open window. An empty stomach makes it difficult to think, so I acted a bit carelessly, I suppose. I do remember things pretty clearly here though. The room smelled very dusty. There were several bags and crates filled with food and probably various other things, around. The sun shone softly into the room through the windows. It didn't feel right to be in there, but I was simply too hungry. So I started digging around in the bags.

Suddenly I felt as if I was being watched, but looking around the room I couldn't make out anything, so I went on. The dried meat didn't taste fantastic, but at least it was something to eat. After a while I heard a noise outside and then a very strange feeling overcame me. My fur stood on end and as I turned around I found a terrifying, dark figure looming over me. A single eye gleamed in the darkness, its stare piercing right through me. Then a strange weight and drowsiness pushed down on me and before I realised it, I had passed out!

I awoke to a soft humming. It felt strangely comforting and warm. I slowly opened my eyes and found myself in a small room, on top of a shelf. The room was fairly small with paper windows to one side and a closed sliding door to the other. Along the walls were some kitchen counters, cabinets, and a stove. A human was working at one of the counters. Being around a human made me feel rather uneasy, so I tried to silently get up and find a way out.

As soon as I had gotten down from the shelf and made a step towards the door, a hand grabbed me from behind and yanked me upwards. The grip was strong, but not to the point of hurting me. I was turned around and looked into the face of a woman. She had blonde hair tied to a knot behind her head and wore a simple, white apron over a short-sleeve kimono. Her eyes were a vibrant yellow and she looked at me with a very stern expression. She proceeded to say something, but I couldn't understand what it was. Looking into her eyes it felt as if I was being drawn into them. The blackness of her pupils seemed to go on forever and ever.

When I came back to my senses I was back down on the floor. Confused, I quickly dashed behind the shelf. I didn't quite know what to do. She didn't seem like an ordinary human-- something was off about her. Still, she didn't seem to want to cause me any immediate harm either. I decided to wait for a bit longer and escape later when it was safer to do so.

After a while the room started to fill with a delightful smell. Peering around the corner I saw the she was still busy cooking, though now had moved over to the stove. Not long after she set down a plate onto the table in the middle of the room. The smell was teasing me a lot now and it didn't take long until I dared to move closer. The woman was pretending to be asleep on the other side of the table. I'm not sure whom she was hoping to fool with that. Still, the disk just looked too inviting, so I quickly snatched a piece.

Before I knew it I had devoured the entire plate. It felt absolutely wonderful to finally have a full stomach again. I have to admit that I had acted quite carelessly, as I started to feel drowsy pretty quickly. The setting sun shone calmly through the paper windows, and everything felt warm and cosy. Not before long it was too difficult to resist the urge to nap.

I awoke to a soft and tranquil light shining into the dark room. Looking around, everything was tinted in a strange and eerie blue. Shadows wandered about as the leaves of the trees moved quietly in a soft breeze. Not a single noise could be heard and it felt as if the moonlight was trying to suffocate all sound. I couldn't even hear my own breath or heart, it was just completely silent all around. I got up as carefully as I could, afraid to disturb the silence.

The kitchen door was now slightly open and I managed to squeeze on through. I found myself in a hallway that seemed to go on forever, its end vanishing in the darkness. The whole atmosphere felt very intimidating, almost as if there was something hidden in the shadows. I carefully walked down the hallway, hoping to find an exit somewhere. The blackness followed behind me, soon swallowing the door to the kitchen. To each side there were doors every now and again, but all of them shut tight and no matter how I tried, I couldn't open any of them.

I don't know how long I walked. It could have been mere minutes or entire hours, my sense of time was completely gone. At some point I finally saw light. Hurrying towards it I found a side way. The left hand of it was a wall of paper windows, through which the moon shone brightly. Tiny specks of dust glimmered in the air, dancing in the silence. The dark silhouettes of trees moved around ominously. I thought I heard a faint sound of rustling leaves, but I might have been imagining that. I considered trying to scratch open one of the windows to make a way out, but decided to first see if there was a way out further down the side way.

And indeed, further down I could see an open door. The closer I got to it, the heavier the air started to feel. Faint flashes of light streamed out into the corridor and it started smelling very strangely, as if I could taste the energy in the air. As I got close enough I could hear a faint buzz and crackling. My hair stood on end and I cautiously got closer to peer inside. What I saw is very difficult to form into words.

It was like looking into a piece of shattered glass. Reality seemed to be fragmented, broken apart. Little pieces that didn't belong, that didn't fit, almost like holes punched into the world, floating about. The holes changed shape and form too in a weird, twitching rhythm. All I could hear now was a loud buzzing and crackling with a low humming undertone. The stench in the room was unbearable, yet I couldn't get myself to move. I was petrified, frozen stiff. And amidst all this madness, in the very centre of the room the woman-- no, the *thing*-- floated; her long strands of hair twisting and flowing around the place like waves of a stormy sea. She seemed very faint-- almost surreal, like someone from out of this world. Suddenly her body shook an arched, twitching oddly. She opened a single eye, an eye that I would never forget. A pupil of pure blackness, surrounded by a fiery hot yellow iris and a gleaming white. Her glance pierced like an arrow right through me. For the next few moments time seemed to have frozen. I could clearly see her expression changing slowly, shock making its way across her face. Her mouth opened, thunder cracked, and then.. the room exploded in an enormous boom! My body shook and the fissures trembled. It took all my strength, but I managed to rip myself out of the trance and threw myself out the door, racing away as fast as I could. Without looking I dashed down the corridor, windows passing by, turning right, running, another corridor, turning left, windows passing by, turning right, left again, and suddenly bushes.

My heart still pounding heavily I continued running, shrubbery and sharp branches scratching me open as I dashed through the woods as far as I could, going who knows where-- anywhere but there. I didn't look where I was going and suddenly I felt the ground escaping from under my feat. I soared through the air. For a brief moment I felt weightless and all sound was gone. My muscles ached and my lungs burned in my chest. The starry sky shone above me. Darkness.

I must have fallen pretty far as it had knocked me out completely. I only remember a few specks from what happened after. I had fever dreams for a good while, but the aching in my bones slowly started to recede. I felt something changing within me. It started to seem as if I was hollow. Something escaped me and was being replaced by something else, but it didn't feel quite right. I don't remember what I dreamed about at the time, unfortunately.

Then suddenly things started feeling exponentially hotter, as if a flame had been ignited inside me and it was burning me up. I felt my body changing too; I grew bigger and much stronger, healthier. I felt completely energised, as if I could tear apart anything I wanted, simply letting it crumble beneath my fingers. A lust for destruction brew up. Oh how fun it would be! The little fox smashing the world apart! I opened my eyes.

I had completely transformed. My body had changed into that of a human's, yet I felt completely normal-- no, better than that. I felt perfect, divine! Nothing could stand in my way now. I pushed against the wall and my hands simply tore a hole in it as if it were nothing. I giggled. Oh it was absolutely marvellous, the best I had felt in all my life! My senses had been heightened as well, I could feel everything around me: the ants below the floor, the birds on the trees outside, and.. something else. Something much bigger and it stood right in the doorway to this room.

I looked up and saw the eye. For a moment I hesitated. But what a joke! As if that would be a mach for me now. I giggled again and then abruptly threw myself at her swinging my arm for a precise punch.

To my surprise she caught my fist with her hand completely without any effort, even almost gently. With a flick of her wrist she threw me flying into the wall. Thinking that I must have underestimated her I decided to try again, no holding back this time. But even this attempt failed. She watched my every move in complete silence, not moving a single part of her body except for her one hand. The next attempt failed too, and the next, as well as the one after that. What.. in the world was she? I tried again a few more times until I was completely exhausted. All this power I had gained.. useless! It was absolutely futile to try to fight against her. Wheezing and panting from the effort I let myself down onto the floor. I couldn't bear looking at her, but I could feel her stare in my back for a good while longer. And then, just as she had appeared, she disappeared again. I was... alone.
