# Ran's perspective
Oh dear, let me see. I mean, these are some of my earliest memories, so I probably won't remember everything without a hitch, but I'll try my best! Hmm, where to begin?

I suppose it would be good to explain my whereabouts before I actually met Yukari for the first time. Needless to say I was still a fox back then. I think it was around late Summer or Fall and it was quite chilly. At the time I was in a bit of a pickle since I didn't have much success finding any food. After a long while of travelling the woods looking for edibles, I --at last-- stumbled upon a house.

I didn't really think too much about it. I quickly found what smelled like a store-room and made my way inside through an open window. An empty stomach makes it difficult to think, so I acted a bit carelessly, I suppose. I do remember things pretty clearly here though. The room smelled very dusty. There were several bags and crates filled with food and probably various other things, around. The sun shone softly into the room through the windows. It didn't feel right to be in there, but I was simply too hungry. So I started digging around in the bags.

Suddenly I felt as if I was being watched, but looking around the room I couldn't make out anything, so I went on. The dried meat didn't taste fantastic, but at least it was something to eat. After a while I heard a noise outside and then a very strange feeling overcame me. My fur stood on end and as I turned around I found a terrifying, dark figure looming over me. A single eye gleamed in the darkness, its stare piercing right through me. Then a strange weight and drowsiness pushed down on me and before I realised it, I had passed out!

I awoke to a soft humming. It felt strangely comforting and warm. I slowly opened my eyes and found myself in a small room, on top of a shelf. The room was fairly small with paper windows to one side and a closed sliding door to the other. Along the walls were some kitchen counters, cabinets, and a stove. A human was working at one of the counters. Being around a human made me feel rather uneasy, so I tried to silently get up and find a way out.

As soon as I had gotten down from the shelf and made a step towards the door, a hand grabbed me from behind and yanked me upwards. The grip was strong, but not to the point of hurting me. I was turned around and looked into the face of a woman. She had blonde hair tied to a knot behind her head and wore a simple, white apron over a short-sleeve kimono. Her eyes were a vibrant yellow and she looked at me with a very stern expression. She proceeded to say something, but I couldn't understand what it was. Looking into her eyes it felt as if I was being drawn into them. The blackness of her pupils seemed to go on forever and ever.

When I came back to my senses I was back down on the floor. Confused, I quickly dashed behind the shelf. I didn't quite know what to do. She didn't seem like an ordinary human-- something was off about her. Still, she didn't seem to want to cause me any immediate harm either. I decided to wait for a bit longer and escape later when it was safer to do so.

After a while the room started to fill with a delightful smell. Peering around the corner I saw the she was still busy cooking, though now had moved over to the stove. Not long after she set down a plate onto the table in the middle of the room. The smell was teasing me a lot now and it didn't take long until I dared to move closer. The woman was pretending to be asleep on the other side of the table. I'm not sure whom she was hoping to fool with that. Still, the disk just looked too inviting, so I quickly snatched a piece.

Before I knew it I had devoured the entire plate. It felt absolutely wonderful to finally have a full stomach again.
