## The Story
I wake up to the sound of buzzing insects. As I lay flat on the dark grass, slowly opening my eyes, I catch a glimpse of the moon behind the clouds. I get up and go to a nearby laboratory, my home, with the pole star showing me the correct way. The pole star always helps me find a way back. Over my life, I've grown to appreciate the stars. Even if they are presently¹ long gone, the stars I see from here still shine brightly². Structures crumble and break, people disappear, nature firmly grasps things from times past, but stars have been my friend and guide all my life.

Soon I see the lab from distance³, a tower like a needle planted in ⁴ground, pointing toward my lifelong companions. Doors⁵ softly creak as I enter the building. I turn on the lights and put food and water I collected onto a counter. I do not⁶ have anything else I need to do right now, so I decide to pass the time by looking at gems from a jewellery box I found the other day. I've been spending time by⁷ looking at them whenever I return back⁸ ever since. Inside the box are many colourful stones of varying shapes and sizes. Some of them have the same colour as my eyes,⁹ those are my favourite. 

I close the lid and return the box to its proper place. It is time to feed the other inhabitant¹⁰ of the building. He isn't able to take care of himself, and there are no more of those people in white suits¹¹ to help him out. They all ran away somewhere one day, and haven't returned yet. But they forgot this poor guy here. I mash the fruit I found outside into a puree and feed it to him on a spoon, but it seems he doesn't want it. He's still laying on the floor with eyes fixed on the ceiling. Maybe it isn't tasty to him. He is certainly a picky eater, but it is my job to help him out.

Maybe tomorrow I'll find something he likes.

## Style, Grammar Remarks
¹ Avoid lawyer vocabulary in situations where it's supposed to be heart-felt.
² What? How can you see the stars if they're long gone?
³ This here is a good example of why present tense is awkward in most cases. Avoid it unless you have a very good and specific reason.
⁴ Missing "the"
⁵ Missing "the". Without it, it means that some random doors somewhere creak, unrelated to the fact that he's entering.
⁶ Probably should be "don't". The explicit "not" should only be used in situations where you want to indicate emphasis on the "not", which is not the case here.
⁷ I'm guessing you want to say that he's been spending some time, but not all of it, looking at those gems. Drop the "by" and possibly even add a "some" before the "time".
⁸ Either "return home", "come back", or "get back".
⁹ Either use a full stop, semicolon or long dash. The following part is not a proper clause.
¹⁰ Again, why the formal, distant choice of vocabulary? He seems to be reminiscing for the most part and the mood appears to be heavy, so something like this appears a bit awkward.
¹¹ "Those people in white suits" makes it sound as if he doesn't understand what doctors are. He appears to be a scientist, so this doesn't make any sense.

## General Critique
I'm a bit confused at the whole thing as there are --unsurprisingly-- a lot of parts that go unexplained. While that isn't necessarily problematic, the issue is more that I don't understand what their connection is supposed to be. The missing stars, the gems, the lab, the ill man, those are all without any apparent connection. I don't even know who or what the protagonist is supposed to be beyond "some dude". Is he a scientist? A random survivor of the implied apocalypse?

You do a decent enough job setting up a mood and an aura of mystery around what's happening, but as indicated there isn't enough for me to turn my confusion into a form of intrigue. Being as short as it is, I think the major problem is just that-- the brevity of it all. If you had expanded on things, explained more about what the setting is about and what the role is of the individual elements we've been shown so far beyond them merely being curiosities floating through the protagonists head, this could have turned out a lot better still.
